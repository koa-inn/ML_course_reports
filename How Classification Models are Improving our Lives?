Classification models are powerful tools that can be used for a whole host of real-world applications and problems. Of the examples presented in these four articles, the most directly beneficial in my mind is the medical applications of breast cancer classification. Being able to create a model which outperforms expert doctors at proper classification of tumors is a very concrete benefit which I imagine has directly saved lives of patients. I find it especially interesting that even a relatively simple model of a support vector machine can improve cancer detection by such a large amount. This article, as well as the two which discuss the effectiveness of Naive Bayes for text analysis, reaffirm to me that often a simpler model algorithm will outperform a more complex or ‘powerful’ model. In the sentiment analysis of movie review article, the author clearly demonstrates that Naive Bayes does a better job of describing the sentiment of text on average over both decision trees and KNN, despite it being arguably a simpler way to classify the text. Overall, these four articles demonstrate that classification machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool with a wide range of practical, real-world applications, but certain models are better suited for certain types of data and problems, and its not always going to be the most sophisticated option.
