Recommender systems may be one of the most clear ways people interact with machine learning on a daily basis. While predictive modeling makes the world go round, a lot of these models and algorithms are obfuscated from most people day to day. However, something that nobody can seemly escape is inexorable rising tide of advertisements, specifically targeted ads. The number of times I have has a conversation which centers around something along the lines of the creepily pertinent ad the popped up the day after talking about that exact product or topic with a friend. These ads are most likely curated by some form of a recommender system which takes in huge amounts of data into consideration when serving you that specific ad. This data could involve information on which products are popular, which products to users similar to you also use, which products might be complementary or related to other purchased products, and likely much more. This algorithm would then be finely tuned with iterative testing, design, and experimentation. While it might not be for a human to sort through all this data and come up with any coherent recommendation, these algorithms can be so effective that they might know what you need before even you do.
